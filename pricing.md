## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can we try OmniDash before we buy?**
A: Yes! We offer a personalized 30-minute demo for any team considering the Professional or Enterprise plan. During the demo, we can discuss a potential proof-of-concept or trial period.

**Q: What counts as a "query" or a "report"?**
A: A "query" is a single question asked to the OpenAI-powered quick answer system. A "report" is a single, more complex analytical request sent to the Claude 3 Opus model. We find our plan limits are generous and more than sufficient for the vast majority of teams.

**Q: Is our data secure?**
A: Absolutely. Security is our top priority. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. Our Enterprise plan offers additional security features and compliance options to meet the needs of large organizations.

**Q: What if we need more AI queries on the Professional plan?**
A: We have add-on packages available for teams that require higher usage. Please contact our sales team for more details.
